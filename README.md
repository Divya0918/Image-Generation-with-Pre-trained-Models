# Image-Generation-with-Pre-trained-Models

## Overview
This project demonstrates image generation from text prompts using pre-trained deep learning models. By leveraging models such as DALL·E-mini or Stable Diffusion, the system converts natural language descriptions into visually meaningful images. The project highlights the capabilities of modern generative models in understanding textual input and producing corresponding images without training a model from scratch.



## Features
 Text-to-image generation using pre-trained models,
 Supports creative prompt-based image synthesis,
 No model training required,
 Generates high-quality and diverse images,
 Simple and user-friendly implementation
