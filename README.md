# Image-Generation-with-Pre-trained-Models
This project demonstrates text-to-image generation using pre-trained generative models such as DALL·E Mini or Stable Diffusion. By providing natural language text prompts, the model generates high-quality images that visually represent the given descriptions, showcasing the power of modern diffusion-based and transformer-based generative models.
